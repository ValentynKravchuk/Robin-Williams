          I think everyone wants the same thing - relationship with humanity,

          hospitality.

        <h2>Skillset</h2>
        <p>
          With skills in over 4 different fields of design, I am the perfect

          needs are, I can pretty much take on any challenge.

            <h2>Product Design</h2>
            <p>
              Working at Facebook has taught me a lot about how to understand
              users, solve problems and build great products.

            <h2>Motion Design</h2>
            <p>
              I started my design journey with motion design in my college days.
              Motion is something that really fascinates me because of the
              flexibility of story telling.

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <p>
              My experience at dribbble has helped me learn to develop the eye
              for design. Colors, typography, layout and the whole package.

            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>
              Clicking pictures really brings out the creative in me. Phtography
              really makes you look and percieve things in a different way.
